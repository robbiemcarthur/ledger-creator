# Claude Workflow Rules

## Critical Rules - NEVER VIOLATE

### 1. FIX BROKEN FIRST
**If production/deployment is broken, STOP ALL NEW FEATURE WORK.**
- No new features
- No refactoring
- No optimization
- ONLY fix the broken deployment
- Only resume normal work after:
  - Build is green ✅
  - All tests pass ✅
  - Deployment succeeds ✅
  - Application starts and runs ✅

### 2. Test-Driven Development
- Write failing test FIRST
- Implement to pass
- Refactor when green
- Commit after each complete cycle

### 3. Small, Frequent Commits
- Commit after each TDD cycle
- Every commit must:
  - Build successfully
  - Pass all tests
  - Not break production

### 4. Follow CODINGSTANDARDS.md
- All fields/parameters/locals marked `final`
- No unnecessary comments
- Expressive code over documentation
- Small, focused methods

### 5. No Code Pollution
- Domain layer: NO framework annotations, NO logging
- Application layer: orchestration only, NO business logic
- Infrastructure layer: adapters only
